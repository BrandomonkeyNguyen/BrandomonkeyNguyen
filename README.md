## Internship Experience
  ### July 2024 - Present:
  ### Intern - Washington Trust Bank Credit Administration Department
* Assessed outdated Excel projects and identified potential improvements. Created formulas to automate the gathering of manual data. Finding important values to optimize appraisal estimates given a set of sales data.
* Learned how to set up Microsoft Sharepoint pages and lists and revamped the department website. Applied teachings from User Experience Design courses to produce a site that is easy to navigate and understand for everyone in the department and beyond.
* Self taught the Microsoft Power Suite (Power Automate, Power BI, Power Apps) and functionally applied the tools to a variety of different areas around the department.
* Transferred outdated visuals from Excel workbooks to a Power BI model. Set up new, well-documented Excel workbooks for gathering and storing data. Recreated the visuals from the old system and improved upon them using the tools in Power BI.
* Set up systems that combine Sharepoint lists, Power Automate Flows, and Power Apps to automate the process of validating fees. Thorough documentation and easy-to-use UX design allowed for an easy transition for end users from the tedious old process.


## [Top-N Genre Classification Neural Network](https://github.com/beatsageo/Top_n) - Senior Capstone Project

I was primarily responsible for the Input Preprocessing portion of this project. I built python scripts using the Librosa library in order to convert audio files into formats that the neural network could read. The best formats for this were ones that could represent the sound frequencies over time. In the early stages, I created a spectrogram generator that was capable of creating jpg spectrogram images. Eventually we discovered MFCCs which are much more efficient. I have mainly worked on bug-fixes as needed by our data acquisition team and generally worked to optimize the scripts. The end goal for the MFCC generator script is for it to be used in the final product to convert user-submitted audio files into MFCCs for the neural network to process.

## [Melody Harbor](https://github.com/BrandonNguyenOSU/Melody-Harbor) - 2024 Class Project

This was a project I worked on while learning about microservices. It provides a front-end to the user that utilizes multiple microservices to allow the user to perform a variety of functions on a database of songs. Some simpler services were used to sort, filter, and store the data in a json file. One of the driving factors of the system is the spotify microservice provided to me by a classmate. This allowed the user to easily populate the database and find new music dynamically.

## [Melody Harbor Database - HTML Frontend and Database](https://github.com/CRTMCQ/melody-harbor) - 2024 Class Project

I worked on this project with a classmate to construct a series of databases consisting of songs, albums, and artists that can be accessed and edited through an HTML front-end.


## [Dungeons and Dragons Sheet Filling Microservice](https://github.com/BrandonNguyenOSU/microservices) - 2024 Class Project

This microservice was created as a collaboration project with a student that was building a character sheet creation assistant. I came up with the idea to turn the resultant data into a sheet image.
